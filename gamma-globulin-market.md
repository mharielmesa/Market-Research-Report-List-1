<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gamma Globulin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection</li><li>Lyophilized powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Gamma Globulin market consists of two main types: Injection and Lyophilized powder. Injection refers to the form in which the gamma globulin is administered directly into the patient's bloodstream through a syringe. This type is convenient as it eliminates the need for reconstitution but requires a healthcare professional for administration. On the other hand, Lyophilized powder is a freeze-dried form of gamma globulin that needs to be reconstituted with sterile water before injection. This form provides longer shelf life and can be easily stored and transported.</p></p>
