<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autotransfusion Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On Pump Transfusion Devices</li><li>Off Pump transfusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Autotransfusion devices are used during surgeries to collect and reinfuse a patient's own blood, minimizing the need for external blood transfusions. On-pump transfusion devices are typically utilized during surgeries involving cardiopulmonary bypass, where blood is collected from the surgical field and then cleaned and filtered before being returned to the patient's circulation. Off-pump transfusion devices, on the other hand, are used during surgeries performed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. These devices collect and process blood from the surgical site without the need for a heart-lung machine.</p></p>
