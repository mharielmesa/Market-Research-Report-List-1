<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cart Paint Sprayer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HVLP</li><li>Airless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the market for cart paint sprayers, there are two common types: HVLP (high volume low pressure) and airless sprayers. HVLP sprayers use a high volume of air at low pressure to atomize the paint, resulting in less overspray and better control. They are suitable for detailed work and indoor applications. On the other hand, airless sprayers use high pressure to pump paint directly from the cart, delivering a higher volume of paint at a faster rate. They are ideal for large-scale projects and exterior surfaces.</p></p>
