<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Percutaneous Indwelling Central Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional PICC</li><li>Power-Injectable PICC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Percutaneous Indwelling Central Catheter (PICC) market consists of two main types: Conventional PICC and Power-Injectable PICC. Conventional PICCs are commonly used for long-term intravenous therapies, such as antibiotics or chemotherapy, as they provide a secure access point in a large central vein. Power-Injectable PICCs, on the other hand, are designed for higher pressure injections, meaning they can be used for contrast-enhanced imaging or for administering medications that require high flow rates. Both types of PICCs serve the purpose of facilitating effective and convenient intravenous therapies for patients.</p></p>
