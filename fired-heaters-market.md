<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fired Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fired Heaters</li><li>Indirect Fired Heaters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fired heaters are used for various industrial processes. Direct fired heaters directly heat the material being processed, like a flame touching the substance. They are commonly used for applications like heating water or air. On the other hand, indirect fired heaters heat an intermediate fluid or heat transfer fluid, which then indirectly heats the substance. This method helps to prevent contamination or maintain specific temperature conditions. Indirect fired heaters are commonly used in processes where the substance being heated needs to remain uncontaminated or there are specific requirements for temperature control.</p></p>
