<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Video Laryngoscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopy</li><li>Unchannelled Video Laryngoscopy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Video laryngoscopy is divided into two main types: channelled video laryngoscopy and unchannelled video laryngoscopy. Channelled video laryngoscopy involves the use of a laryngoscope with a separate channel to guide the endotracheal tube into the trachea during intubation. This type allows for better visualization of the airway and precise guidance. On the other hand, unchannelled video laryngoscopy uses a laryngoscope with no separate channel for intubation. Both types provide enhanced visualization during intubation procedures, but channelled video laryngoscopy offers additional guidance for tube placement.</p></p>
