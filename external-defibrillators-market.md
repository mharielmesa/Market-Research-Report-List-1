<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automated External Defibrillators (AED)</li><li>Manual External Defibrillators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>External defibrillators are medical devices used to restore normal heart rhythms in patients experiencing cardiac arrest. The market for external defibrillators can be categorized into two types: Automated External Defibrillators (AED) and Manual External Defibrillators. AEDs are portable, user-friendly devices that automatically analyze the heart rhythm and deliver a shock if needed. They are commonly found in public spaces and can be used by non-medical personnel. Manual external defibrillators, on the other hand, require a healthcare professional to interpret the heart rhythm and determine the appropriate shock level. They are typically used in hospitals and ambulances for more advanced cardiac care.</p></p>
