<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bragg Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hollow Core</li><li>Solid Core</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bragg fibers are optical fibers that have a periodic variation in their refractive index, causing a light wave to reflect back upon itself. There are two main types of Bragg fibers: hollow core and solid core. Hollow core Bragg fibers have a central air channel surrounded by a periodic arrangement of high and low refractive index materials. They are used for applications that require low-loss transmission of light, such as telecommunication. Solid core Bragg fibers, on the other hand, have a solid core surrounded by periodic layers of high and low refractive index materials. They are ideal for applications like high-power lasers or amplifiers.</p></p>
