<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tactical Interception System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The tactical interception system market includes two types: active and passive. In the active market, interception systems actively engage in the interception process by locating, capturing, and decoding the targeted signals. These systems require high power and may interfere with the intercepted signals. On the other hand, the passive market involves systems that silently listen to and record targeted signals without interfering with them. These systems are more discreet and do not alert the target about the interception. Both types have their own advantages and limitations in various interception scenarios.</p></p>
