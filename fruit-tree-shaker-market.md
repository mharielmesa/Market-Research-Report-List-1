<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fruit Tree Shaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mounted</li><li>Self-propelled</li><li>Trailed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mounted fruit tree shakers are attachments that are mounted onto tractors or other vehicles. They are convenient for use in orchards with sufficient space for maneuvering. Self-propelled shakers, on the other hand, are standalone machines that can move independently within the orchard. They are more flexible and suitable for smaller orchards or those with limited space. Trailed shakers are attached to a separate vehicle and towed behind it. This type is useful for larger orchards where multiple trees can be shaken simultaneously, increasing efficiency.</p></p>
