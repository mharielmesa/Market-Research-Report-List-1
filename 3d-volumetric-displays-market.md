<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Volumetric Displays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swept-Volume Display</li><li>Solid-Volume Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Swept-Volume Display and Solid-Volume Display are two types of 3D volumetric displays. Swept-Volume Display creates images by rotating a 2D plane or light source in three dimensions, generating a series of 2D images that reconstruct a 3D scene. Solid-Volume Display, on the other hand, uses a physical medium to create a 3D visual through the emission, scattering, or reflection of light. Both types have their unique advantages and limitations in terms of image quality, viewing angles, and cost, shaping the diverse market of 3D volumetric displays.</p></p>
