<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Fuel Cell Stacks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-cooled Type</li><li>Water-cooled Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydrogen fuel cell stacks are crucial components in fuel cell systems that convert the chemical energy of hydrogen into electrical energy. They come in two main types: air-cooled and water-cooled. </p><p>Air-cooled fuel cell stacks are cooled by air circulating through the stack, which reduces complexity and cost but may limit power output and require more space. Conversely, water-cooled fuel cell stacks use water circulation to cool down the stack, offering higher power output potential, smaller size, and lower operating temperatures, but at the expense of increased complexity and cost.</p></p>
