<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microprocessor Ventilatior Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microprocessor ventilator market can be classified into two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators are used for patients who require intubation, where a tube is inserted into their windpipe. These ventilators provide a controlled flow of oxygen into the lungs. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, do not require intubation and are used for patients who can breathe on their own but need assistance. These devices deliver oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs, helping the patient maintain proper oxygen levels. Both types play a crucial role in providing respiratory support to patients in need.</p></p>
