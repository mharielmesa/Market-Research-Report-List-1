<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impregnated Paper Insulated Cable</li><li>Oil-filled Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The submarine cable market comprises different types of cables used for underwater communication. Impregnated paper insulated cables are designed with layers of impregnated paper to provide electrical insulation. They are cost-effective but have limited data transmission capacity. Oil-filled cables use oil as a coolant and an insulator, allowing for higher power transmission. They are more expensive but offer greater bandwidth. Both types play a crucial role in enabling efficient data transfer and telecommunication services underwater.</p></p>
