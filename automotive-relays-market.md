<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Open Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive relays are classified into two main types: closed type and open type. Closed type relays are sealed and designed to protect them from dust, water, and other contaminants, making them suitable for use in harsh environments. On the other hand, open type relays are not sealed and are more cost-effective, but they are not as durable as closed type relays. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the automotive application.</p></p>
