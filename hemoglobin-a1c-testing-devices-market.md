<p><strong>The Hemoglobin A1c Testing Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laboratory Testing</li><li>Point-of-Care (POC) Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hemoglobin A1c testing devices are used to measure the average blood sugar level over a period of time. This testing is commonly performed in two settings: laboratory testing and point-of-care (POC) testing. Laboratory testing involves sending blood samples to a central lab where they are analyzed by professionals using specialized equipment. On the other hand, POC testing allows for immediate analysis of blood samples with portable devices at the patient's bedside, doctor's office, or other healthcare settings. Both laboratory testing and POC testing aim to accurately determine the patient's glycemic control for effective diabetes management.</p></p>
