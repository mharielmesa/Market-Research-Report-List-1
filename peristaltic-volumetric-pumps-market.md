<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peristaltic Volumetric Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Speed Regulation</li><li>Frequency Speed Regulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peristaltic Volumetric Pumps are divided into two types: Mechanical Speed Regulation and Frequency Speed Regulation. </p><p>Mechanical Speed Regulation refers to the type of peristaltic pump that adjusts its speed using mechanical means, such as changing gears or adjusting the size of the motor pulley. This allows for manual control of the pump's flow rate and can be suitable for applications requiring a constant flow rate.</p><p>On the other hand, Frequency Speed Regulation involves using electronic means, such as adjusting the frequency of the electric current, to control the pump's speed. This type of pump allows for more precise and automated control of the flow rate, making it suitable for applications where accurate dosing or variable flow rates are required.</p></p>
