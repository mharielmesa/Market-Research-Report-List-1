<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shrink Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Shrink Guns</li><li>Automatic Shrink Guns</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shrink guns are classified into two main market types: manual and automatic shrink guns. Manual shrink guns require manual operation, where the user needs to hold the gun and apply heat to shrink the wrapping material. These guns are commonly used for smaller-scale applications and provide more control over the shrink process. On the other hand, automatic shrink guns have a built-in mechanism that automatically applies heat and shrinks the material without the need for manual operation. These guns are ideal for larger-scale operations, improving efficiency and reducing labor requirements.</p></p>
