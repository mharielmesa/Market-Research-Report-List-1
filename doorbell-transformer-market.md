<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doorbell Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-Voltage Transformers</li><li>Center-Tapped Transformers</li><li>Multiple-Tapped Transformers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The doorbell transformer market includes three types of transformers: fixed-voltage transformers, center-tapped transformers, and multiple-tapped transformers. Fixed-voltage transformers provide a specific voltage output that cannot be adjusted, ensuring consistent power delivery to the doorbell system. Center-tapped transformers have a center tap in the secondary winding, enabling the selection of different voltages by connecting to either end or the center tap. Multiple-tapped transformers offer more versatility as they have multiple taps on the secondary winding, allowing for a wider range of voltage options to accommodate various doorbell systems.</p></p>
