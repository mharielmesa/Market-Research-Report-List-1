<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Righting Lifeboat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Lifeboat</li><li>Freefall Lifeboat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-righting lifeboat market includes two main types: conventional lifeboats and freefall lifeboats. Conventional lifeboats are designed to be dropped from the side or stern of a vessel, and they right themselves in the water using a combination of buoyancy and stability. On the other hand, freefall lifeboats have a unique design that allows them to be released from a high point on a vessel, enabling an immediate freefall into the water. Both types of lifeboats serve the vital purpose of providing a safe and efficient means of evacuation during emergencies at sea.</p></p>
