<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual Fuel Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Four-Stroke</li><li>Two-Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The dual fuel engine market comprises two main types: four-stroke and two-stroke engines. A four-stroke engine completes the combustion process in four stages: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. It offers higher efficiency, lower emissions, and better fuel economy. On the other hand, a two-stroke engine completes combustion in two stages, combining intake and compression with power and exhaust. While it has higher power-to-weight ratio and simplicity, it tends to be less fuel-efficient and generates more emissions compared to a four-stroke engine.</p></p>
