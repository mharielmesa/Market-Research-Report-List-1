<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ventilation devices can be classified into two main types: non-invasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators provide respiratory support to patients without the need for intubation, using a face mask or nasal interface. They are typically used for patients with mild to moderate respiratory issues. In contrast, invasive ventilators require intubation and deliver oxygen directly into the patient's lungs via a breathing tube. They are used for patients with severe respiratory problems or those who are unable to breathe on their own. Overall, these devices aim to assist in the respiratory function of patients in different ways.</p></p>
