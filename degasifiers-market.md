<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Degasifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Packed Towers</li><li>Tray Towers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Degasifiers are used to remove unwanted gases from liquids. Packed towers and tray towers are two common types of degasifiers. Packed towers consist of structured packing materials such as ceramic or metal sheets that provide a large surface area for gas-liquid contact. Tray towers, on the other hand, contain multiple trays or plates that facilitate gas-liquid separation. Both these market types offer effective solutions for degasification purposes, with packed towers offering ease of maintenance and tray towers providing higher efficiency due to the use of trays.</p></p>
