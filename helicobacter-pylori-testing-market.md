<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helicobacter Pylori Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Endoscopy</li><li>Without Endoscopy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Helicobacter pylori testing is a diagnostic tool used to identify the presence of the bacteria in the stomach. There are two types of H. pylori testing markets: with endoscopy and without endoscopy. With endoscopy testing involves inserting a thin tube with a camera through the mouth to examine the stomach lining and collect tissue samples for analysis. Without endoscopy testing utilizes non-invasive methods like blood, breath, or stool tests to detect H. pylori antigens, antibodies, or genetic material. Both approaches help diagnose H. pylori infection, but with endoscopy provides more detailed information about the stomach's condition.</p></p>
