<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zirconia Ceramic Block for Denture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Block</li><li>Disc</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Zirconia Ceramic Block for Denture market consists of two main types: Block and Disc. Blocks are solid pieces of zirconia ceramic material that can be used to create dental prosthetics such as dentures. They are usually larger in size and require a milling machine to shape them into the desired form. On the other hand, discs are thinner and come in different sizes that can fit into a dental milling machine directly, allowing for easier and more efficient production of dentures. Both Block and Disc varieties play crucial roles in the production of zirconia dentures.</p></p>
