<p><p>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) patient monitors are portable devices used to continuously monitor and measure blood pressure levels in patients for a period of 24 hours or longer. These devices are typically worn by patients on a belt around their body and are connected to a cuff that inflates at regular intervals to measure blood pressure. ABPM patient monitors provide a more accurate representation of a patient's blood pressure profile than traditional office-based measurements as they record blood pressure at various intervals throughout the day.</p><p>The global ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) patient monitors market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period. The market is driven by factors such as the rising prevalence of hypertension, an increasing geriatric population, and a growing awareness of the importance of regular blood pressure monitoring. Additionally, technological advancements in ABPM devices, such as wireless connectivity and smartphone compatibility, have also contributed to market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the ABPM patient monitors market is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies. These technologies enable the analysis of large amounts of data collected by ABPM devices and improve the accuracy of blood pressure readings. AI-powered ABPM monitors can also provide personalized insights and recommendations to patients, helping them manage their blood pressure more effectively.</p><p>Another trend in the market is the development of wearable ABPM devices. These devices offer greater convenience and comfort to patients, as they can be worn discreetly under clothing and do not require frequent cuff inflations. Wearable ABPM monitors also allow for more extended monitoring periods, leading to more comprehensive blood pressure data.</p><p>In summary, the global market for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) patient monitors is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by factors such as increasing hypertension prevalence and technological advancements. The integration of AI and machine learning technologies, as well as the development of wearable devices, are among the latest trends in the market.</p></p>
