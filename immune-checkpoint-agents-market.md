<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immune Checkpoint Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-PD-L1 Drug</li><li>Anti-PD-1 Drug</li><li>CTLA4</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immune checkpoint agents market is divided into three types: Anti-PD-L1 drugs, Anti-PD-1 drugs, and CTLA4 inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 drugs target the protein PD-L1 found on tumor cells, blocking its interaction with immune cells and enhancing the immune system's ability to attack cancer. Anti-PD-1 drugs work by blocking the PD-1 protein on immune cells, preventing it from binding with PD-L1 and enabling immune cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. CTLA4 inhibitors target the protein CTLA4 on immune cells, enhancing the immune response against cancer cells.</p></p>
